- What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I was having some difficulty understanding branching.

- What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
I have a better understanding of branching and how feature branches relate to the master branch. This GPS also made me more comfortable with version-control.

- What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I asked my guide about the meaning of “origin,” and what some of the best practices are for naming feature branches.

- What still confuses you about git?
I’m still a little confused about resolving merge conflicts. When you resolve a merge conflict on your local master branch, I’m unsure how to go about updating the remote master.

- How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
I think my first GPS went well. It helped clarify some key concepts and allowed us to practice using some of the things we learned the previous week. I learned that it is important to timebox effectively so that we can cover all the material in the presence of the guide.
